"description": "TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) gene expression by RNAseq.<br><br> The gene expression profile was measured experimentally using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing platform by the University of North Carolina TCGA genome characterization center. Level 3 interpreted level data was downloaded from TCGA data coordination center. This dataset shows the gene-level transcription estimates, as in RSEM normalized count. Genes are mapped onto the human genome coordinates using UCSC cgData HUGO probeMap.

Users can view the original non-normalized values by uncheck the \"Normalize\" option. For more information on how to use the cancer browser, please refer to the help page.<br><br>",
